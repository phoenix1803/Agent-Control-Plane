# 🚀 Extension Loading Guide

## ✅ What Just Happened

Your VS Code extension has been compiled and opened in **development mode** with the extension loaded!

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Generate a Trace (if you haven't already)
```bash
npm run demo
```
This creates a trace file in `traces/` folder.

### 2. Open the Extension Command Palette
Press: **`Ctrl+Shift+P`** (Windows/Linux) or **`Cmd+Shift+P`** (Mac)

### 3. Find the Command
Type: **`ACP: Open Trace File`**

You should see these commands available:
- ✅ **ACP: Open Trace File** ← Use this one
- ACP: Show Trace Inspector
- ACP: Run Demo Agent  
- ACP: Analyze Current Trace

### 4. Select a Trace
Choose a trace file from the `traces/` folder. You should see:
- 📝 `replays/` subfolder contains replayed traces
- 🔧 Traces generated by `npm run demo`

### 5. Enjoy the UI!
Once a trace loads, you'll see:
- **8 Playback Buttons**: ⏮ ◀ ▶ ⏸ ▶ ⏭ 🎯 🔍
- **Progress Bar**: Shows 0-100% completion
- **Step Details**: Input/Output JSON, timestamps
- **Step List**: All steps with type indicators

## 🎮 Button Guide

| Button | Name | Action |
|--------|------|--------|
| ⏮ | Start | Jump to first step |
| ◀ | Prev | Step backward |
| ▶ | Play | Auto-play all steps |
| ⏸ | Pause | Pause playback |
| ▶ | Next | Step forward |
| ⏭ | End | Jump to last step |
| 🎯 | Jump | Jump to specific step |
| 🔍 | Search | Find steps by content |

## 🔄 Reload Extension

If you make changes to the extension code:
1. In VS Code, press **`Ctrl+R`** (or Cmd+R on Mac)
2. The extension will reload

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"Command not found" error?**
- Close VS Code completely
- Run: `npm run compile` (in vscode-extension folder)
- Re-run the extension launch command

**No traces showing?**
- Run: `npm run demo` first to generate a trace
- Check the `traces/` folder

**Extension won't load?**
- Check console: View → Debug Console (F5)
- Look for red errors
- Verify TypeScript compiled: `npm run compile`

## 📂 File Structure

## 💡 Pro Tips

2. **Auto-play speed**: Each step defaults to 1 second
3. **Jump to any step**: Click 🎯 button, enter step number
